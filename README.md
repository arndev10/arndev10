**My Philosophy:**
- 🚀 Start with an **MVP** and iterate based on real feedback
- 🔧 Focus on **solving actual problems**, not just building features
- 📈 Continuously improve through **iterative development**
- 🎓 Stay humble and learn something new every day
- 📋 Apply **PMI methodologies** to ensure quality and structured delivery

I specialize in **Python automation**, **full-stack development**, and acting as a **Data Translator**—bridging the gap between business needs and technical implementation. I've successfully reduced operational processing times by **99.5%** through intelligent automation and workflow optimization.

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

### MVP → Iteration → Production
Every project starts as a **Minimum Viable Product** that solves a core problem. Through structured iteration and continuous feedback, features are refined and enhanced until reaching production-ready quality.

### PMI Standards in Development
All projects are developed following **PMI (Project Management Institute) standards**:
- 📋 Structured planning and requirements gathering
- 🔄 Iterative development cycles
- 📊 Risk management and quality assurance
- 📈 Continuous monitoring and improvement
- 📝 Comprehensive documentation

### Problem-First Approach
I focus on **real-world problems** rather than technology for its own sake. Each project addresses a specific need:
- **Control Fit App**: Understanding body composition beyond just weight
- **PDF to MP3**: Making books accessible offline without subscription costs
- **Audio Transcriber**: Privacy-focused transcription without API dependencies
